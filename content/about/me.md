# Hi there!

I'm Michael and a computer science student from austria! I love starting projects and one of my biggest weaknesses is to finish one of my sideprojects :)

I graduated at HTL Leonding in the branch IT/Media-technologies, but my heart lies at the IT part.

For all of my personal projects check out my Github and my posts here about my projects.

## Linux / FOSS Meetup
I'm one of the three organizers of the Linz [Linux / FOSS meetup](https://www.meetup.com/linux-foss-linz/). With our meetup that occurs every 3-4 months we built an amazing community that I'm really proud of.

If I find the time you can also find me around some other meetups like the Cloudnative meetup in Linz

## Skills and Interests

### Java / Kotlin
I do most of my stuff in Kotlin when it can be written in Kotlin because i really fell in love with this language

### Full Stack
Even though I fell in love with self-hosting stuff, doing programing puzzles and repairing my linux machine I also did many full-stack projects with various technologies like: React, Vue.js, Medusa, Quarkus, Springboot...
But when for the frontend I also like to think about [pureweb.dev](pureweb.dev), because my nose is full of all the bloated frameworks.

### Linux
I am currently running Gentoo on my machine and own about 4 Thinkpads that run various distros.

I love using vim and hyprland :)

### Kubernetes Cluster
My fever for self-hosting every application that can be self-hosted on my 2 nodes will never come to a rest, even if it's way to overengineered for my personal use.

### Programing Challenges
The greatest joy of programming for me lies in wrapping my head around puzzles and solving them. Peak examples of such events are the CCC (Cloudflight Coding Contest) and Advent of Code

Here's my routine for Advent of Code the past few years:
1. Get up at 6am
2. Try to solve the puzzle before school/work
3. If the puzzle still isn't finished cry and continue solving
4. Repeat 25 Days

Congrats! Thats how I achieve all 50 Stars every year and I love it!


## Hobbies
### Magic the Gathering & Board Games
I have been playing Mtg since 2020 and think it's one of the greatest games ever! I enjoy drafting with friends and playing Commander.

I also have a small board game collection and always delighted to have some gaming evening with friends.

### Cooking
I also like to cook healthy food :)
